# SESAK: A Crowd Simulation Tool

## Software Description
SESAK is a copyright crowd simulation software (copyright no: MYIPO LY2017001317) that has been developed by our team to simulate the movement of crowd in a space/area to provide insights on how crowd would behave in different environments. It can be used to evaluate performance and safety of environment in every phase of the life cycle; from design to operation. In this tool, SESAK software will be integrated with building design drawing to anticipate congestions occurences and propose alternative solutions or remedial actions to designers using swarm intelligence optimization. 

## Model Development 
* Crowd Dynamics using Social Force Model 
* Path Finding using A* Algorithm
* Optimization Engine using Artificial Bee Colony Optimization

## Environment Drawing
* Support Modular Type Building Design (using vertical and horizontal line)
* Customized Door Sizes
* Customized Comfort Test Zone
* Customized Evacuation Area
* Customized Agent Position, Walk Speed and Body Radius

## Fundamental Analysis


## Installation


## References
There are 2 type of objective function used in the optimization algorithm which are;
* single-objective problem
* multi-objective problem 

Details on the crowd simulation model (crowd dynamics) and optimization algorithm used in this software is available from here.
